# Password-Strength-Generator
You can generate random passwords or check your passwords strength here

I have used used 2 standard libraries of python here namely 're' and 'random'.

're' is used to search or find a particular string/s which is basically Regualr Expressions.

'random.sample(string,n)' is used to generate a sequence of charcters of length n
